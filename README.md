# Simple Banking Exercise 

The Banking-Exercise directory is a truffle project that contains the required contract, migration and test files. I was trying to implement the SimpleBank.sol contract to enroll a participating account. This account will be able to Deposit and withdraw.

The contract contains the framework and comments of how the implementation of the contract was made.

To test this implementation start the development blockchain by running truffle develop. From the truffle console, compile and migrate the contracts by running compile and migrate. You can run the pre-written tests by running 'truffle test'.

If the tests do not pass, modify the contract, recompile, redeploy and retest. Iterate until all of the tests pass. And this has passed all the test.
